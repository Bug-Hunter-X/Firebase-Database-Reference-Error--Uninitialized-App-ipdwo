# Firebase Database Reference Error: Premature Access

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using the Firebase Realtime Database: attempting to access a database reference before the Firebase app has fully initialized.  The `bug.js` file shows the incorrect implementation that leads to the error. The corrected implementation that avoids the error is provided in `bugSolution.js`. 

## Problem

The problem arises from accessing the database reference too early in the application's lifecycle. Asynchronous operations, such as Firebase initialization, take time to complete.  Accessing the database reference before it's ready can throw a `null` or `undefined` reference error. 

## Solution

The solution involves using an asynchronous approach (promises or async/await) to ensure the Firebase app has been initialized before performing database operations. The `bugSolution.js` file showcases the use of promises to address this issue.
